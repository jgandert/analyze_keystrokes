# Analyze Keystroke Data

The [original dataset](#dataset) used here has approximately 136 million presses and 168 thousand volunteers.

After filtering out suspicious (too fast) and incorrect data (e.g., uppercase letter, but no shift pressed), about 55 million presses and 77 thousand volunteers are left.

## Usage

### Step 1: Filter and convert the dataset (Optional)

1. Download the [136 Million Keystrokes dataset](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/136Mkeystrokes/). (1,4 GiB)
2. Extract the downloaded dataset into the `extract_archive_in_here` directory. (16 GiB unzipped)
3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run [filter_and_convert_keystroke_dataset.py](filter_and_convert_keystroke_dataset.py).

---

If you'd like to skip this step, you can download the filtered version (`filtered_events.csv.gz`) from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgandert/analyze_keystrokes/releases) and move it to the `dataset` directory.

### Step 2: Analyze converted dataset and create training dataset

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run [analyze.py](analyze.py).

If you'd like to use the resulting training dataset to train prediction functions, head over to the [evolve_tap_hold_predictors](https://github.com/jgandert/evolve_tap_hold_predictors) repository.

Evolved functions are used in the [Predictive Tap-Hold community module for QMK](https://github.com/jgandert/qmk_modules/tree/main/predictive_tap_hold).

üìä Open [**analyze.md**](analyze.md) to see the output for the default settings.
